# Description

MobilityAI is a team from McMaster University researching Human Activity Recognition (HAR) in conjunction with Juravinski Hospital. We are using a wireless sensor band to record patient mobility data and extract activity information using machine learning. We currently have 3 positions available, focusing on Frontend, Backend and Machine Learning respectively.

## Frontend

### Technology

* HTML/CSS/Javascript - React Native
* Java - Android

### Summary

As a Frontend developer, you will be working closely with the doctors and nurses are Juravinski Hospital to develop new visualizations for patient activity data. As well as working to take full advantage of the [MetaWear API](https://mbientlab.com/androiddocs/latest/index.html).

## Backend

### Technology

* C# - ASP.NET Core
* SQL - Postgres

### Summary

As a Backend developer, you will be working on optimizing sensor data ingestion and developing ergonomic APIs for the Frontend team.

## Machine Learning

### Technology

* Python - SciKit Learn

### Summary

As a Machine Learning developer, you will be researching tools and techniques to improve the quality of the machine learning model driving the activity recognition of this project.
